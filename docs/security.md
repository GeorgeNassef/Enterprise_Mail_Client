# Security Considerations

## Authentication and Authorization

### Azure AD Integration
- OAuth 2.0 implementation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Conditional access policies
- Multi-factor authentication support

### Zero Trust Implementation
1. Identity Verification
   - Every request authenticated
   - Token validation
   - Session management
   
2. Access Control
   - Least privilege principle
   - Just-in-time access
   - Regular access reviews

3. Network Security
   - Micro-segmentation
   - Encrypted communications
   - Network monitoring

## Data Protection

### In Transit
- TLS 1.3 enforcement
- Perfect forward secrecy
- Strong cipher suites

### At Rest
- Encryption key management
- Data classification
- Retention policies

## Compliance Requirements

### Audit Trail
- Comprehensive logging
- Tamper-evident logs
- Regular audit reviews

### Privacy Controls
- Data minimization
- Purpose limitation
- User consent management

## Security Testing

### Continuous Security
- Automated security testing
- Dependency scanning
- Container security scanning
- Regular penetration testing

### Incident Response
- Documented procedures
- Regular drills
- Post-incident analysis

## Security Architecture Components

### API Gateway
- Request validation
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection
- WAF integration

### Service Mesh
- mTLS between services
- Traffic encryption
- Access policies
- Certificate management

### Secrets Management
- Vault integration
- Key rotation
- Access auditing
- Secure storage

## Compliance and Governance

### Standards Alignment
- ISO 27001
- SOC 2
- GDPR (if applicable)
- Industry-specific requirements

### Security Policies
- Access control policy
- Data handling policy
- Incident response policy
- Change management policy

## Regular Reviews
- Security architecture reviews
- Threat modeling
- Risk assessments
- Compliance audits
